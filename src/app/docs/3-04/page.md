## A. Discipline committee 

There shall be a discipline committee consisting of the pastor and the board of deacons.  These men shall have sole authority in determining heretical deviations from the Statement of Faith and violations of the church covenant.  If the pastor or a deacon is the subject of a disciplinary matter, he shall not sit as a member of the discipline committee.  The pastor and deacons shall be entitled to the same steps as other church members and be subject to the same discipline.

## B. Step 1 - 1 on 1 confrontation

Members are expected to demonstrate special loyalty and concern for one another.  When a member becomes aware of an offense of such magnitude that it hinders spiritual growth and testimony, he is to go alone to the offending party and seek to restore his brother.  Before he goes, he should first examine himself.  When he goes, he should go with a spirit of humility and have the goal of restoration.

## C. Step 2 - 2 on 1 confrontation

If reconciliation is not reached, a second member, either a deacon or the pastor, is to accompany the one seeking to resolve the matter.  This second step should also be preceded by self-examination and exercised in a spirit of humility with the goal of restoration.

## D. Step 3 - involvement of the discipline committee

If the matter is still unresolved after the steps outlined in subsections B and C have been taken, the discipline committee should proceed lovingly and cautiously, as the church representatives Biblically responsible for putting down murmuring, shall hear the matter.  If the matter is not resolved during the hearing before the discipline committee, the committee shall recommend to the members of the church that they, after self-examination, make an effort personally to go to the offending member and seek that member's restoration.

## E. Step 4 - vote before the church

If the matter is still unresolved after the steps outlined in B, C, and D have been taken, such members who refuse to repent and be restored are to be removed from the membership of the church upon a majority vote of the membership present at a meeting called for the purpose of considering disciplinary action.

## F. All steps required in order

No matter may be heard by the discipline committee or the church unless the steps outlined in section B and C have been taken, except in the case of a public offense.

## G. Removed fellowship

If the unrepentant offending party is removed from the church membership, all fellowship with him from that point forward must be for the sake of restoration.

## H. Biblical support

The procedures provided in this section are based on Matthew 18:15-20; Romans 16:17-18; 1 Corinthians 5:1-13, 2 Corinthians 2:1-11; Galatians 6:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:14; 2 Thessalonians 3:6; 10-15; 1 Timothy 5:19-20; and Titus 3:10-11.
