Upon the dissolution of the church, the trustees shall, after paying or making provision for payment of all the liabilities of the church, dispose of all of the assets of the church to such organization or organizations formed and operated exclusively for religious purposes as shall at the time qualify as an exempt organization or organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (or the corresponding provision of any future United Stated Internal Revenue Law), as the trustees shall determine.  Assets may be distributed only to tax-exempt organizations which agree with the church's Statement of Faith.
