The church officers are pastor ([see Section 5.01](/docs/5-01)), deacon ([see section 5.02](/docs/5-02)), church clerk ([see Section 5.03](/docs/5-03)), church treasurer ([see Section 5.04](/docs/5-04)).  One personal may hold two or more offices, except that of pastor.  The pastor, from time to time as he deems appropriate, may appoint other church officers, subject to confirmation vote of the church membership.
