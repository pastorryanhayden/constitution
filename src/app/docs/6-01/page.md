Unless otherwise determined by the pastor, the church shall meet each Sunday for public worship both morning and evening and at least once during the week for Bible study and prayer.  Except when circumstances forbid it, the ordinance of the Lord's Supper shall be observed as the Pastor feels led by the Holy Spirit.  The Lord's Supper is a special time for the church as explained in [1 Corinthians 11:23-24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/11/23/s_1073023).
