## A. Voting 

Only members at least eighteen years of age who are physically present at a duly called meeting of the church shall be entitled to vote.  There shall be no proxy or absentee voting.  The eligible membership of the church has certain limited areas to exercise a vote.  Members may not vote to initiate any church action, rather the vote of a member is to confirm and ratify the direction of the church as determined by the pastor and the board of deacons.

## B. Nature of government 

The congregation functions not as a pure democracy, but as a body under the headship of the Lord Jesus Christ and the direction of the pastor as the under-shepherd with the counsel of the board of deacons.  Determinations of the internal affairs of this church are ecclesiastical matters and shall be determined exclusively by the church's own rules and procedures.  The pastor shall oversee and/or conduct all aspects of this church.  The board of deacons shall give counsel and assistance to the pastor as requested by him.

## C. Property

Membership in this church does not afford the members with any property, contractual, or civil rights based on the principles of democratic government.  Although the general public is invited to all of the church's worship services, the church property remains private property.  The pastor (or in his absence, an individual designated by the board of deacons) has the authority to suspend or revoke the right of any person, including a member, to enter or remain on church property.  If after being notified of such a suspension or revocation, the person enters or remains on church property, the person may, in the discretion of the pastor (or in his absence, an individual designated by the board of deacons), be treated as a trespasser.

## D. Right to inspect financial statements 

A member may inspect or copy the prepared financial statements of the church and the minutes of the proceedings of church meetings and of board meetings, provided he shall have made verbal request upon the church and the church has received the written request at least five business days before the requested inspection date.

### 1. Limits

A member may not, under any circumstances, inspect or copy any record relating to individual contributions to the church, the list of names and addresses of the church members, or the accounting books and financial records of the church.

### 2. Fees

The church may impose a reasonable charge, covering the costs of labor and material, for copies of any documents provided to the member before releasing the copies to the members.
