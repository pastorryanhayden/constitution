All educational programs or courses of instruction shall be conducted consistent with the teaching of the inerrant Word of God.  Any assertion or belief which conflicts with or questions a Bible truth is a pagan deception and distortion of the truth which will be disclaimed as false.  It is the responsibility of every instructor or teacher to present the inerrant Word of God as the sole infallible source of knowledge and wisdom.
