The following comprise the Scriptural beliefs of this church and its members.

## A. The Holy Scriptures

We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the verbally and plenarily inspired Word of God. The Scriptures are inerrant, infallible and God-breathed and, therefore, are the final authority for faith and life. The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testament are the complete and divine revelation of God to Man. The Scriptures shall be interpreted according to their normal grammatical-historical meaning, and al issues of interpretation and meaning shall be determined by the pastor. The Authorized MDCXI King James Version of the Bible shall be the official and only translation used by the church. ([2
Tim. 3:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2ti/3/16/s_1128016); [2 Pet. 1:20-21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2pe/1/20/s_1157020))

## B. The Godhead
We believe in one triune God, eternally existing in three persons- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-each co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co- equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections. ([Deut. 6:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/deu/6/4/s_159004); [Matt. 28:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/28/19/s_957019); [John 14:10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/14/10/s_1011010), [26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/14/26/s_1011026); [2 Cor. 13:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2co/13/14/s_1091014))


## C. The Person and Work of Christ.

1. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men. ([Isa. 7:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/isa/7/14/s_686014); [9:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/isa/9/6/s_688006); [Luke 1:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/1/35/s_974035); [John 1:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/1/1-2/s_998001), [14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/1/14/s_998014); [2 Cor. 5:19-21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2co/5/19-21/s_1083019); [Gal. 4:4-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gal/4/4-5/s_1095004); [Phil. 2:5-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/phl/2/5-8/s_1105005))
2. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and, that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead. ([Acts 2:18-36](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/2/18-36/s_1020018); [Rom. 3:24-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/3/24-25/s_1049024); [Eph. 1:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/1/7/s_1098007); [1 Pet. 2:24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/2/24/s_1153024); [1 Peter 1:3-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/1/3-5/s_1152003))
3. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate. ([Acts 1:9-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/1/9-10/s_1019009); [Rom. 8:34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/8/34/s_1054034); [Heb. 9:24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/heb/9/24/s_1142024); [7:25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/heb/7/25/s_1140025): [1 John 2:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1jo/2/1-2/s_1161001))

## D. The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit.
1. We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and, that He is the Supernatural Agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption. ([John 16:8-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/16/8-11/s_1013008); [Rom. 8:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/8/9/s_1054009); [1Cor. 12:12-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/12/12-14/s_1074012); [2 Cor. 3:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2co/3/6/s_1081006); [Eph. 1:13-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/1/13-14/s_1098013))
2. We believe that He is the divine Teacher who assists believers to understand and appropriate the Scriptures and that it is the privilege and duty of all the saved to be filled with the Spirit. ([Eph. 1:17-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/1/17-18/s_1098017); [5:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/5/18/s_1102018); [1John 2:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1jo/2/20/s_1161020), [27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1jo/2/27/s_1161027))
3. We believe that God is sovereign in the bestowal of spiritual gifts to every believer. God uniquely uses evangelists, pastors, and teachers to equip believers in the assembly in order that they can do the work of the ministry. ([Rom. 12:3-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/12/3-8/s_1058003); [1 Cor. 12:4-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/12/4-11/s_1074004), [28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/12/28/s_1074028); [Eph. 4:7-12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/4/7-12/s_1101007))
4. We believe that the sign gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and the gift of healing, were temporary. Speaking in tongues was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism or filling of the Holy Spirit. Ultimate deliverance of the body from sickness or death awaits the consummation of our salvation in the resurrection, though God frequently chooses to answer the prayers of believers for physical healing. ([1 Cor. 1:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/1/22/s_1063022); [13:8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/13/8/s_1075008); [14:21-22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/14/21-22/s_1076021))

## E. The Fall of Man . 

We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God; but that in Adam's sin the human race fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God. Man is a sinner and continues to sin by choice and unable to save himself or remedy his lost condition. ([Gen. 1:26-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/1/26-27/s_1026); [Rom. 3:22-23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/3/22-23/s_1049022); [5:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/5/12/s_1051012); [6:23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/6/23/s_1052023); [Eph. 2:1-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/2/1-3/s_1099001); [4:17-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/4/17-19/s_1101017))

## F. God's Purpose of Grace. 

We believe the Scriptures teach that election is the eternal purpose of God, according to which he graciously regenerates, sanctifies and saves sinners; that being perfectly consistent with Individual Soul Liberty, it comprehends all the means in connection with the end; that it is a most glorious display of God's sovereign goodness, being infinitely free, wise, holy and unchangeable; that it utterly excludes boasting and promotes humility, love, prayer, praise, trust in God; that it may be ascertained by its effects in all who truly believe the Gospel; that it is the foundation of Christian assurance.

## G. Salvation. 

We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, Whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins. ([Matt. 12:31-32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/12/31-32/s_941031), [John 1:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/1/12/s_998012); [Eph.
1:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/1/7/s_1098007); [2:8-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/2/8-10/s_1099008); [1Pet. 1:18-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/1/18-19/s_1152018); [1John 1:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1jo/1/9/s_1160009))

## H. The Eternal Security and Assurance of Believers.

1. We believe that all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God's power and are thus secure in Christ forever. ([John 6:37-40](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/6/37-40/s_1003037); [10:27-30](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/10/27-30/s_1007027); [Rom. 8:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/8/1/s_1054001); [38-39](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/8/38-39/s_1054038); [1Cor. 1:4-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/1/4-8/s_1063004); [1 Pet. 1:4-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/1/4-5/s_1152004))

2. We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God's Word, which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh. ([Rom. 13:13-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/13/13-14/s_1059013); [Gal. 5:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gal/5/13/s_1096013); [Titus 2:11-15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/tit/2/11-15/s_1131011))

## I. The Church

1. We believe that the local church is a congregation of baptized believers associated by a covenant of faith and fellowship of the gospel. ([1 Cor. 12:12-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/12/12-14/s_1074012); [Eph. 1:22-23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/1/22-23/s_1098022); [5:25-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/5/25-27/s_1102025))

2. We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures. ([Acts 14:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/14/27/s_1032027); [20:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/20/17/s_1038017), [28-32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/20/28-32/s_1038028); [1 Tim. 3:1-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1ti/3/1-13/s_1122001); [Titus 1:5-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/tit/1/5-11/s_1130005))

3. We believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control. ([Acts 13:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/13/1-4/s_1031001); [15:19-31](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/15/19-31/s_1033019); [20:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/20/28/s_1038028); [Rom. 16:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/16/1/s_1062001), [4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/16/4/s_1062004); [1Cor. 3:9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/3/9/s_1065009), [16](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/3/16/s_1065016); [5:4-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/5/4-7/s_1067004), [13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/5/13/s_1067013); [1Pet. 5:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/5/1-4/s_1156001))

4. We recognize water baptism and the Lord's Supper as the Scriptural ordinances of obedience for the church in this age. ([Matt. 28:19-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/28/19-20/s_957019); [Acts 2:41-42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/2/41-42/s_1020041); [8:36-38](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/8/36-38/s_1026036); [Matt.26:26-29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/26/26-29/s_955026); [1Cor. 11:17-34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/11/17-34/s_1073017))
  1. We believe that water baptism is by immersion in water of a believer. In the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit, with the authority of the local church as a testimony of the death, burial and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
  2. We believe that the Lord's supper is for baptized believers belonging to this local church. In the which the members of the church by the use of bread and fruit of the vine are to commemorate together the suffering and dying love of our Lord Jesus Christ. Which is preceded always by solemn self examination of each member of the congregation.

## J. Separation. 

We believe that all the saved should live in such a manner as not to bring reproach upon their Savior and Lord. God commands His people to separate from all religious apostasy, all worldly and sinful pleasures, practices, and associations, and to refrain from all immodest and immoderate appearances, piercings, and bodily markings. ([Lev. 19:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/lev/19/28/s_109028); [Rom. 12:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/12/1-2/s_1058001); [14:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/14/13/s_1060013); [1Cor. 6:19-20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/6/19-20/s_1068019); [2 Cor. 6:14-](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2co/6/14-1/s_1084014)[7:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2co/7/1/s_1085001); [2Tim. 3:1-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2ti/3/1-5/s_1128001); [1John 2:15-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1jo/2/15-17/s_1161015); [2 John 9-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2jo/1/9-11/s_1165009))

## K. The Resurrection and Return of Christ. 
We believe in and accept the sacred Scriptures upon these subjects. Of the resurrection, we believe that Christ arose bodily *"the third day according to the Scriptures"*, that He ascended *"to the right hand of the throne of God"*, by the power of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, *"That this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven"*, bodily, personally, and visibly, that the *"dead in Christ shall rise first;"* that the living saints *"shall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump"*, *"that the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His Father David."* and that *"Christ shall reign a thousand
years in righteousness until he hath put all enemies under His Feet."*  (Mat. 28:6-7; Luke 24:39; John 20:27; I Cor. 15:4; Mark 16:6; Luke 24:2;4-6; Acts 1:9;11; Luke 24:51; Mark 16:19; Rev. 3:21; Heb. 8:1; Heb, 12:2; Heb. 8:6; I Tim. 2:5; I John 2:1; Heb. 2:17 Heb. 5:9-10; John 14:3; I Thes. 4:16; I Cor. 15:52; I Cor. 15:42-44; ICor. 15: 51-53; IThess. 4;17; Phil.4:20-21; Luke 1:32; ICor. 15:25; Isa. 11:4-5; Psa. 72:8; Rev. 20:1-4; Rev.20:6; Rom.8:34; Heb. 10:19)

## L. The Eternal State.
1. We believe in the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to eternal life, and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment. (Matt. 25:46; John 5:28, 29; 11:25-26; Rev. 20:5-6, 12-13)
2. We believe that the souls of the redeemed are, at death, absent from the body and present with the Lord, where in conscious bliss they await the first resurrection, when spirit, soul, and body are reunited to be glorified forever with the Lord. (Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 5:8; Phil. 1:23; 3:21; 1Thess. 4:16-17; Rev. 20:4-6)
3. We believe that the souls of unbelievers remain, after death, in conscious punishment and torment until the second resurrection, when with soul and body reunited, they shall appear at the Great White Throne Judgment, and shall be cast into the Lake of Fire, not to be annihilated, but to suffer everlasting conscious punishment and torment. (Matt. 25:41-46; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:19-26; 2 Thess. 1:7-9; Jude 6-7; Rev. 20:11-15)

## M. The Reality of Satan. 

We believe that Satan is a person, the author of sin and the cause of the Fall of Man; that he is the open and declared enemy of God and man; and that he shall be eternally punished in the Lake of Fire. (Job 1:6-7; Isa. 14:12- 17; Mat. 4:2-11; 25:41; Rev. 20:10)

## O. Creation. 

We believe in the Genesis account of creation, and that it is to be accepted literally, and not allegorically or figuratively; that man was created directly in God's own image and after his own likeness. We reject evolution, the Gap Theory, the Day-Age Theory, and Theistic Evolution as unscriptural theories of origin. Gen. 1:1-2; Ex. 20:11; Acts 4:24; Col. 1:16-17; Neb. 11:3; John 1:3; Rev. 10:6; Rom.1:20; Acts 17:23-26; Jer. 10:12; Neh. 9:6; Gen. 1:26-27; Gen. 2:21-23; Gen. 1:11; Gen. 1:24.

## P. Civil Government. 
We believe that God has ordained and created all authority consisting of three basic institutions: 1) the home, 2) the church, and 3) the state. Every person is subject to these authorities, but all (including the authorities themselves) are answerable to God and governed by His Word. God has given each institution specific Biblical responsibilities and balanced those responsibilities with
the understanding that no institution has the right to infringe upon the other. The home, the church, and the state are equal and sovereign in their respective
Biblically assigned spheres of responsibility under God. (Rom. 13:1-7; Eph. 5:22- 24; Heb. 13:17; 1 Pet. 2:13-14)

## Q. Human Sexuality.
1. We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of a marriage between one man and one woman. We believe that any form of homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, bestiality, incest, fornication, adultery, and pornography are sinful perversions of God's gift of sex. We believe that God disapproves ofand forbids any attempt to alter one's gender by surgery or appearance. (Gen. 2:24; Gen. 19:5, 13; Gen. 26:8-9; Lev. 18:1-30; Rom. :1 26-29; 1 Cor. 5:1; 6:9; 1 Thess. 4:1-8; Heb. 13:4)
2. We believe that the only Scriptural marriage is the joining of one man and one woman. (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22-23) (Section 5.01-D)

## R. Family Relationships
1. We believe that men and women are spiritually equal in position before God but that God has ordained distinct and separate spiritual functions for men and women in the home and the church. The husband is to be the leader of the home, and men are to be the leaders (pastors and deacons) of the church. Accordingly, only men are eligible for licensure and ordination by the church. (Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:18; 1 Tim. 2:8-15; 3:4-5, 12)
2. We believe that God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. The husband is to love his wife as Christ loves the church. The wife is to submit herself to the Scriptural leadership of her husband as the church submits to the headship of Christ. Children are an heritage from the Lord. Parents are responsible for teaching their children spiritual and moral values and leading them, through consistent lifestyle example and appropriate discipline, including Scriptural corporal correction. (Gen. 1:26-28; Ex. 20:12; Deut. 6:4-9; Ps. 127:3-5; Prov. 19:18; 22:15; 23:13-14; Mk. 10:6-12; 1 Cor. 7:1-16; Eph. 5:21-33; 6:1-4, Col. 3:18-21; Heb. 13:4; 1 Pet. 3:1-7)

## S. Divorce and Remarriage. 

We believe that God disapproves of and forbids divorce and intends marriage to last until one of the spouses dies. Divorce and remarriage is regarded as adultery except on the grounds of fornication. Although divorced and remarried persons or divorced persons may hold positions of service in the church and be greatly used of God for Christian service, they may not be considered for the offices of pastor or deacon. (Mal. 2:14-17; Matt. 19:3-12; Rom. 7:1-3; 1 Tim. 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6)

## T. Abortion. 

We believe that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a living human being. Abortion constitutes the unjustified, unexcused taking of unborn human life. Abortion is murder. We reject any teaching that abortions of pregnancies due to rape, incest, birth defects, gender selection, birth or population control, or the physical or mental well being of the mother are acceptable. We reject any teaching that accepts the harvesting of human embryos as means to further science. (Job 3:16; Ps. 51:5; 139:14-16; Isa. 44:24; 49:1, 5; Jer. 1:5; 20:15-18; Luke 1:44)

## U. Euthanasia. 
We believe that the direct taking of an innocent human life is a moral evil, regardless of the intention. Life is a gift of God and must be respected from conception until natural death. Thus we believe that an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder contrary to the will of God. Discontinuing medical procedures that are extraordinary or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be a legitimate refusal of over-zealous treatment. (Ex. 20:13, 23:7; Mat. 5:21; Acts 17:28)

## V. Love. 

We believe that we should demonstrate love for others, not only toward fellow believers, but also toward both those who are not believers, those who oppose us, and those who engage in sinful actions. We are to deal with those who oppose us graciously, gently, patiently, and humbly. God forbids the stirring up of strife, the taking of revenge, or the threat or the use of violence as a means of resolving personal conflict or obtaining personal justice. Although God commands us to abhor sinful actions, we are to love and pray for any person who engages in such sinful actions. (Lev. 19:18; Mat. 5:44-48; Luke 6:31; John 13:34-35; Rom.12:9-10; 17-21; 13:8-10; Phil. 2:2-4; 2 Tim. 2:24-26; Titus 3:2; 1John 3:17-18)

## W. Lawsuits Between Believers. 

We believe that Christians are prohibited from bringing civil lawsuits against other Christians or the church to resolve personal disputes. We believe the church possesses all the resources necessary to resolve
personal disputes between members. We do believe, however, that a Christian may seek compensation for injuries from another Christian's insurance company as long as the claim is pursued without malice or slander. 1( Cor. 6:1-8; Eph. 4:31-32)

## X. Missions. 

We believe that God has given the church a great commission to proclaim the Gospel to all nations so that there might be a great multitude from every nation, tribe, ethnic group, and language group who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. As ambassadors of Christ we must use all available means to go to the foreign nations and not wait for them to come to us. (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-48; John 20:21; Acts 1:8; 2 Cor. 5:20)

## Y. Giving. 

We believe that every Christian, as a steward of that portion of God's wealth entrusted to him, is obligated to financially support his local church. We believe that God has established the tithe as a basis for giving, but that every Christian should also give other offerings sacrificially and cheerfully to the support of the church, the relief of those in need, and the spread of the Gospel. We believe that a Christian relinquishes all rights to direct the use of his tithe or offering once the gift has been made. (Gen. 14:20;, Prov. 3:9-10; Acts 4:34-37; 1Cor. 16:2;, 2 Cor. 9:6-7; Gal. 6:6; Eph. 4:28; 1Tim. 5:17-18; 1John 3:17)
