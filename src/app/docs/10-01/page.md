    description: 
---

From time to time the church, in the exercise of its religious, educational, and charitable purposes, may establish various funds to accomplish specific goals.  Contributors may suggest uses for their contributions, but all suggestions shall be deemed advisory rather than mandatory in nature.  All contributions made to specific funds or otherwise designated shall remain subject to the exclusive control and discretion of the pastor and the board of deacons.  No fiduciary obligation shall be created by any designated contribution made to the church other than to use the contribution for the general furtherance of any purpose stated in [Section 1.02](/docs/1-02).
