    title: 2.02 Authority of the Statement of Faith
    description: How the statement of faith relates to the Bible.
---


The Statement of Faith does not exhaust the extent of our faith.  The Bible itself is the sole and final source of all that we believe. We do believe, however, that the foregoing Statement of Faith accurately represents the teaching of the Bible and, therefore, is binding upon all members.  All literature used in the church shall be in complete agreement with the Statement of Faith.
