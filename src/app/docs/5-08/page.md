All elected or appointed leaders must be committed to the following:

1. Faithful church attendance
2. Giving of their tithes and offerings to support the church
3. Keeping an exemplary Christian lifestyle by abstaining from excessive anger, the use of alcohol or tobacco, gossiping, keeping a clean and godly appearance in dress and manner, and avoiding all forms of worldliness.
4. Following the leadership of the pastor as being God's appointed leader in the church. ([Acts 20:28](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/20/28/s_1038028) and [Hebrews 13:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/heb/13/7/s_1146007), [17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/heb/13/17/s_1146017))
5. In event that a person no longer wishes to serve in a position of leadership, that person is to submit a written/signed statement to the pastor (or deacons if the church is without a pastor) stating their decision and the reasons for that decision.
